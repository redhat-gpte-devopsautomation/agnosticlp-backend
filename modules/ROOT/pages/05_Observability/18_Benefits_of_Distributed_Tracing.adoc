Transcript:

Distributed tracing offers several benefits. It helps with root cause analysis, enabling you to identify where the first failure happened. The trace contains both error code and a message.

Distributed tracing is useful in helping with performance optimization. It lets you identify whether a service is not functioning properly and how that is impacting performance optimization.

Distributed tracing also helps with service dependency visualization.
