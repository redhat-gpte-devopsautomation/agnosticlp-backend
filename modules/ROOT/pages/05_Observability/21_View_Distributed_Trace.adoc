Transcript:

Distributed tracing enables you to use tools to view the distributed trace. For example, in the previous example, traces exist that are collected and processed by a distributed tracing solution. The image shown here is from a distributed tracing solution named Jaeger. Jaeger is covered in more depth later in this module.

As you can see, distributed tracing provides the trace of a request across services. It helps to determine which services were touched, when, and in which order. It also shows how long a given service executed so you can address performance issues if needed.
