== What Is An Event

* Event
** Immutable state and value of a particular entity, which occurred during operation among services.

* Command
** Async form of Remote Procedure Call, contains instructions telling recipient what to do, may cause a change of state.

* Query
** Similar to commands, queries expect a response returning the results, but do not cause any change in state.
