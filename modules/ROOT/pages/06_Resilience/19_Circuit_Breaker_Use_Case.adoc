== Circuit Breaker Use Case

* Circuit Breaker is an application design pattern for avoiding cascading failures in distributed architecture

* Example of a cascading failure:
** Application running in app container with dependencies to N subsystems
** Single dependency shows increased latency under high volume
** User requests threads become saturated
** Entire application becomes unresponsive

* Applying a circuit breaker enables fast failure rather than clients trying to connect to an overloaded or failing host.
