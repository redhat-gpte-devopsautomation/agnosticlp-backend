== Microprofile Metrics

* The MicroProfile Metrics specification allows applications to gather various metrics and statistics that provide insights into what is happening inside the application.

* The metrics are also valuable to monitor how Fault Tolerance policies are operating, e.g.

** When Retry is used, it is useful to know how many times a method was called and succeeded after retrying at least once.

** When Timeout is used, you would like to know how many times the method timed out.

* Because of this requirement, when Microprofile Fault Tolerance and Microprofile Metrics are used together

* metrics are automatically added for each of the methods annotated with a @Retry, @Timeout, @CircuitBreaker, @Bulkhead or @Fallback annotation.
