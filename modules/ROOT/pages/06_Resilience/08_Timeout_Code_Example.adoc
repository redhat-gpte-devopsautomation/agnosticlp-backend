== Timeout Code Example

* Annotate a method with @Timeout, the execution will be aborted after the defined threshold.

----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Timeout;

@Timeout(500)
public String callRemoteService() {
    // call a remote service
    // it may timeout
}
----

* The above code-snippet means the method callRemoteService applies the Timeout policy, which is to fail the execution if the execution takes more than 500ms to complete.

* When a timeout occurs, a TimeoutException is thrown.
