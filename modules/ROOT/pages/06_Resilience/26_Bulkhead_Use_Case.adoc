== Bulkhead Use Case

* The Bulkhead pattern is to prevent faults in one part of the system from cascading to the entire system, which might bring down the whole system. 

** The implementation is to limit the number of concurrent requests accessing to an instance. 

** Therefore, Bulkhead pattern is only effective when applying @Bulkhead to a component that can be accessed from multiple contexts.

* There are two different approaches to the bulkhead: thread pool isolation and semaphore isolation. 
** When @Bulkhead is used with @Asynchronous, the thread pool isolation approach will be used. 
*** The thread pool approach allows to configure the maximum concurrent requests together with the waiting queue size. 
** If @Bulkhead is used without @Asynchronous, the semaphore isolation approach will be used. 
*** The semaphore approach only allows the concurrent number of requests configuration.
