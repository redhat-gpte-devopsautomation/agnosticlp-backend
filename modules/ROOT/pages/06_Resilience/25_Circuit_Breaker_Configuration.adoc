== Circuit Breaker Configuration

Following configuration options are available for @CircuitBreaker

* delay: The delay after which an open circuit will transitions to half-open state.

* delayUnit: the unit of measure, ChonoUnit.SECONDS, .MINUTES etc

* failOn: The list of exception types which should be considered failures

* failureRatio: The ratio of failures within the rolling window that will trip the circuit to open.

* requestVolumeThreshold: The number of consecutive requests in a rolling window that will trip the circuit.

* skipOn: The list of exception types which should not be considered failures

* successThreshold: For an open circuit, after the delay period is reached, once the successThreshold is reached, the circuit is back to close again.
