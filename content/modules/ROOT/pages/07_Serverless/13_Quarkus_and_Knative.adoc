* Latency
** Knative scales services to zero when there are no requests
** Low time-to-first response required
** Traditional Java stacks cannot provide this
** Quarkus with Native support enables the cloud-native application to start-up very quickly
* Developer support
** Modern cloud-native applications need immutable containers and support for event-driven architectures
** Quarkus with Knative stack allows developers to build, deploy, and run optimized serverless applications on Java in Kubernetes
** Developers can innovate with a language they are comfortable in
