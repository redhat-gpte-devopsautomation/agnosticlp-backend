== Pact Testing Development Process

* On the consumer side, interactions against a mock version of the API are recorded. 

* The pact is shared with the provider. There are different ways to do so. 
** The Pact ecosystem contains a Pact broker, which acts a a repository for pacts. 
** A simpler way is to add to pact files to the code base of the API provider.

* The provider verifies the contracts against the implementation 
** Verifying that the implementation does honor the contracts.
