== Additional Benefits of Mocking

* Faster response time
** Mocks can give faster response time, since there is minimal network latency

* Mock external components
** Save costs by not using a external components (if external API is monetized)
** Avoid API throttling limits
** Continue development if external API is not developed yet

 * Perform simulations  
 ** Simulation different response times and error codes
 ** Observe how your application behaves during unfavorable conditions
