Transcript:

Distributed tracing can be thought of as the story of a request across services. It helps to determine which services were touched, when, in which order, and with what instance information. This information might include routing information, version, and tags.

Distributed tracing is not a replacement for logging. Tracing does not have process- or thread-level details. Also, it is important to note that not all traces are sampled.
