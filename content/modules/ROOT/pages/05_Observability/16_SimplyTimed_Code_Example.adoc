== SimplyTimed Code Example

* Collect metrics about latency and throughput of persistence operations.
----
    @SimplyTimed(name = "IncidentService.repository", tags = {"operation=create"}, absolute = true)
    @Transactional
    public JsonObject create(JsonObject incident) {
        Incident created = repository.create(toEntity(incident));

        return fromEntity(created);
    }
----

* The `name` attribute is the name of the timer, and will also be the name of the metrics produced. 

* The `tags` attribute allow to further subdivide the metrics. 

* The `absolute` attribute determines if the name should be pre-fixed with the class name. if true, the name will not be pre-fixed.
