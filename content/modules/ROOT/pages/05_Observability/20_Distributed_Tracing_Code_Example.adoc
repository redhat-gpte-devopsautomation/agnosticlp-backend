try (Scope scope = tracer.buildSpan("submitOrder").startActive(true)) {

    chargeCreditCard();
    changeOrderStatus();
    dispatchEventToInventory();
}
----

ifdef::showscript[]

Transcript:

Shown here is the same code example with support for distributed tracing added. The process is wrapped in a try/catch block. The tracer is used to build a span named submitOrder. This makes tracing support available for this operation.
