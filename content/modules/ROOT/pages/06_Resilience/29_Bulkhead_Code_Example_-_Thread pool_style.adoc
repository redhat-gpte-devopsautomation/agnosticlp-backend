== Bulkhead Code Example - Thread Pool Style

* Execution happens on a separate thread and the concurrent requests are confined in a fixed number of a thread pool.

----
   @Asynchronous
   @Bulkhead(value = 5, waitingTaskQueue = 10)
   ​public String callRemoteService() {
        // call a remote service
        // it may fail
   ​}
----

* In this example, we specify a maximum of 5 concurrent calls to an instance. The thread pool has fixed size 10.

* When using the thread pool approach, when a request cannot be added to the waiting queue, BulkheadException will be thrown.
