== Timeout Use Case

* When calling an external service, the service may take a long time. It may be hard to determine where the service is down or if the service is just slow

* Applying a timeout policy prevents your application from waiting forever for the external service to complete. This allows your application to fail-fast.

* Microprofile Fault Tolerance provides the @Timeout annotation to support this functionality.
