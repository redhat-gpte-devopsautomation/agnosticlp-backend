== Fallback Use Case

* A Fallback method is invoked if a method annotated with @Fallback completes exceptionally.

* Fallback provides a default / fallback operation if it makes sense for given application problem domain. 

* The Fallback annotation can be used on its own or together with other Fault Tolerance annotations. 

* The fallback is invoked if an exception would be thrown after all other Fault Tolerance processing has taken place.

* For a Retry, Fallback is handled any time the Retry would exceed its maximum number of attempts.
