== Circuit Breaker

* Circuit breaker: Wraps calls to dependent service(s)

* Original state: Closed

** Circuit breaker implementation monitors calls to dependent service

** When failures (time-out, exception) hit  preconfigured threshold, circuit breaker trips open

* When open, calls to dependent service are no longer made, but fallback response returned

* Circuit breaker moves to half-open state after configurable time

** In half-open state, circuit breaker executes remote calls periodically to monitor dependent service's health

** When service becomes healthy again, state switches back to closed
