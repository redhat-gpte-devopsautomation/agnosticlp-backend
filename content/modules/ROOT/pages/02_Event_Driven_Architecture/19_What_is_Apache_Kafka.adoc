Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. It is built to be an horizontally-scalable and fault-tolerant. Kafka allows distributed data streams and stream processing applications

The Kafka streaming platform has three key capabilities:

* Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
- Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
- Process streams of records as they occur.

Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:
- Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between - systems or applications
- Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data
