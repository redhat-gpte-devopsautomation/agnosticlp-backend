Transcript:

Modern expectations of near-realitime experiences, combined with modern application development using architectures like microservices and serverless is driving much more usage of events. For example, the need to sync state and data across clouds, or the desire to isolate components of a system to provide better fault tolerance and scalability.  And from the business perspective, the need for faster time to market calls for more agility in application development and deployment. All of these can be enhanced by the use of event-driven systems.
