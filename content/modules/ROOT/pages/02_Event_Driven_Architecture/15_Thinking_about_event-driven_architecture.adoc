== Thinking About Event-driven Architecture

* To truly gain benefits of event-driven, one must rethink the architecture

* Re-cast the architecture in terms of events 

* Instead of using ad-hoc events when needed

* Events become the language to describe interactions of the system

* Design appropriate software architecture and components to handle those events

To truly gain benefits of event-driven, one must rethink things - and re-cast their architectures in terms of events, so that instead of using ad-hoc events when needed, events become the language in which an applicationâ€™s behavior is expressed, and describe interactions of the system. This can then be used to design an appropriate software architecture and components to handle those events.
